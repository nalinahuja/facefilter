Milestones:

  Facial Detection Model:
    The facial detection model will be programmed to detect if a human face is within the camera's viewfinder and trigger the facial mapping model if a human face is detected.

      Model Training: INCOMPLETE
      Model Validation: INCOMPLETE

      Accuracy - TBD%

  Facial Mapping Model:
    The facial mapping model will be programmed to map a human face in an image given that it knows there is a human face in the camera's viewfinder. The mapping of the human face will be used to add features to the human face that track the motion of the face.
