FaceFilter
----------

Facial Detection Model:
  The facial detection model will be programmed to detect if a human face is within the camera's viewfinder and trigger the facial mapping model if a human face is detected.

  Status:
    Accuracy: 85.00%

Facial Mapping Model:
  The facial mapping model will be programmed to map a human face in an image given that it knows there is a human face in the camera's viewfinder. The mapping of the human face will be used to add features to the human face that track the motion of the face.

  Status:
    Accuracy: 98.50%

Facial Masking Algorithm:
  The facial masking algorithm will use the keypoints from the facial mapping model to add image masks to all human faces detected in the camera's viewfinder.
